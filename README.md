# VisitCounter

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/KensoDev/visit-counter.png)](https://secure.travis-ci.org/KensoDev/visit-counter)

VisitCounter is a gem which solves the annoying problem of counting visits and displaying them in real time. In an SQL database, for a site with a lot of hits, this can cause quite a lot of overhead. VisitCounter aims to solve this by using a quick key-value store to keep a delta, and only persist to the SQL DB when the delta crosses a certain percent of the saved counter.
It can be used transparently, by overriding the accessor to the counter, or simply by using the helper functions it defines - incr_counter, read_counter, get_counter_delta and nullify_counter.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'visit-counter'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install visit-counter

## Usage

a. the default storage engine is redis. If you have a global $redis for your redis connection, we default to using that. Otherwise, or if you want to specify a different connection, in an initializer you should define it by:

    VisitCounter::Store::RedisStore.redis = Redis.new(host: "your_redis_host", port: port)

b. in the class you wish to have a visit counter simply declare
    include VisitCounter
from this moment on, you can use the incr_counter(:counter_name), nullify_counter(:counter_name) and read_counter(:counter_name) methods
You can also do something like this:

    class Foo < ActiveRecord::Base
       include VisitCounter
       cached_counter :counter_name
    end

this will override the counter_name method to read the live counter (from both database and the NoSQL storage) and add a increase_counter_name method for upping the counter by 1 (in the NoSQL and/or persist to DB when needed)

##Thresholds

the default behaviour of visit counter is that once the visits pass 30% of the staged number, the visit counter stages the changes and nullifies the delta. You can, however, tweak that method. including VisitCounter in a class creates two class attribute_accessors, one named visit_counter_threshold_method, the other visit_counter_threshold.
visit_counter_threshold_method accepts either :static or :percent (the default), the threshold is either the decimal percent (0.1 for 10%) or an integer for :static. in case of the :static method you will percist to the DB once every (threshold) times the counter goes up.

so you might want to do something like that:

    class Foo < ActiveRecord::Base
       include VisitCounter
       cached_counter :counter_name
       visit_counter_threshold_method = :static
       visit_counter_threshold = 100
    end

if you want the counter to persist to database once every 100 views.
